been paid on any sum, and such aggregate (if any) shall be deemed to be income received by the employee in the previous year in which the recognition of the fund takes effect and shall be included in the employee's total income for that previous year, and, for the purposes of assessment, the remainder of the transferred balance shall be disregarded, but no other exemption or relief, by way of
