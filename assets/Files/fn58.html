      58. In <i>Orissa Trust of Technical Education </i>v.<i> Chief CIT </i>[2008] 178 Taxman 363 (Ori.), it was held that prescribed authority for the years 1999-2001 was the CBDT and thereafter such power of approval came to be vested in the Chief Commissioner. In terms of rule 2CA it is the ‘prescribed authority’ alone which could deal with the application for approval and no other. No amount of waiver or consent can confer jurisdiction on a Court which it inherently lacks or where none exists. Lack of jurisdiction strikes at the very root of exercise of statutory powers and vitiates the proceeding themselves. Thus, merely because the assessee filed application for approval for period 1999-2001 to the Chief Commissioner and not to CBDT this fact of making such applications by itself could not and would not vest any authority of law with the Chief Commissioner to deal with such application. The conduct of the assessee in making of an application before an authority, who otherwise lacks jurisdiction cannot in law amount to vesting such an authority, with jurisdiction to deal with the same and further in view of the law stated above in such a case Chief Commissioner was also wrong in passing a common order for assessment years 1998-99 to 2005-06.
