      78. Since advance of interest-free loan or loan at concessional rate of interest by employer to its employees reduces employee's financial liability which can be considered as an income saved, it can undoubtedly be treated as 'fringe benefit' or 'amenity' given to employee—<i>BHEL Employees' Association </i>v.<i> Union of India</i> [2003] 128 Taxman 309/261 ITR 15 (Kar.). Rule will apply even to cases where, in addition to debtor-creditor relationship, there exists employer-employee relationship—<i>CIT </i>v. <i>C. Kulandaivelu Konar </i>[1975] 100 ITR 629 (Mad.). Mere fact that loan was treated as deemed dividend under section 2(<i>22</i>)(<i>e</i>) will not be an impediment to the application of this rule—<i>CIT </i>v. <i>T.P.S.H. Selva Saroja </i>[2000] 244 ITR 671 (Mad.).</p>
