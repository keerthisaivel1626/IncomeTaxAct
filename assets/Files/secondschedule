<p class="tx" style="text-align: center">GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Definitions.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>1.</b> In this Schedule, unless the context otherwise requires,—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) "certificate", except in rules 7, 44, 65 and sub-rule (2) of rule 66, means the certificate drawn up by the Tax Recovery Officer under 
<a href="javascript:ShowMainContent('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000058383', '');">section 222</a> in respect of any assessee referred to in that section;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) "defaulter" means the assessee mentioned in the certificate;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>c</i>) "execution", in relation to a certificate, means recovery of arrears in pursuance of the certificate;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>d</i>) "movable property" includes growing crops;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>e</i>) "officer" means a person authorised to make an attachment or sale under this Schedule;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>f</i>) "rule" means a rule contained in this Schedule; and </p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>g</i>) "share in a corporation" includes stock, debenture-stock, debentures or bonds.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Issue of notice.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>2.</b> When a certificate has been drawn up by the Tax Recovery Officer for the recovery of arrears under this Schedule, the Tax Recovery Officer shall cause to be served upon the defaulter a notice requiring the defaulter to pay the amount specified in the certificate within fifteen days from the date of service of the notice and intimating that in default steps would be taken to realise the amount under this Schedule.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>When certificate may be executed.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>3.</b> No step in execution of a certificate shall be taken until the period of fifteen days has elapsed since the date of the service of the notice required by the preceding rule:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that, if the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the defaulter is likely to conceal, remove or dispose of the whole or any part of such of his movable property as would be liable to attachment in execution of a decree of a civil court and that the realisation of the amount of the certificate would in consequence be delayed or obstructed, he may at any time direct, for reasons to be recorded in writing, an attachment of the whole or any part of such property:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided further</b> that if the defaulter whose property has been so attached furnishes security to the satisfaction of the Tax Recovery Officer, such attachment shall be cancelled from the date on which such security is accepted by the Tax Recovery Officer.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Mode of recovery.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>4.</b> If the amount mentioned in the notice is not paid within the time specified therein or within such further time as the Tax Recovery Officer may grant in his discretion, the Tax Recovery Officer shall proceed to realise the amount by one or more of the following modes :—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) by attachment and sale of the defaulter's movable property;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) by attachment and sale of the defaulter's immovable property;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>c</i>) by arrest of the defaulter and his detention in prison;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>d</i>) by appointing a receiver for the management of the defaulter's movable and immovable properties.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Interest, costs and charges recoverable.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>5.</b> There shall be recoverable, in the proceedings in execution of every certificate,—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) such interest upon the amount of tax or penalty or other sum to which the certificate relates as is payable in accordance with sub-section (2) of 
<a href="javascript:ShowMainContent('Act', 'CMSID', '102120000000058377', '');">section 220</a>, and</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) all charges incurred in respect of—</p>
<p class="indent2A"> (<i>i</i>)  the service of notice upon the defaulter to pay the arrears, and of warrants and other processes, and </p>
<p class="indent2A">(<i>ii</i>)  all other proceedings taken for realising the arrears.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Purchaser's title.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>6.</b> (1) Where property is sold in execution of a certificate, there shall vest in the purchaser merely the right, title and interest of the defaulter at the time of the sale, even though the property itself be specified.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Where immovable property is sold in execution of a certificate, and such sale has become absolute, the purchaser's right, title and interest shall be deemed to have vested in him from the time when the property is sold, and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Suit against purchaser not maintainable on ground of purchase being made on behalf of plaintiff.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>7.</b> (1) No suit shall be maintained against any person claiming title under a purchase certified by the Tax Recovery Officer in the manner laid down in this Schedule, on the ground that the purchase was made on behalf of the plaintiff or on behalf of some one through whom the plaintiff claims.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Nothing in this section shall bar a suit to obtain a declaration that the name of any purchaser certified as aforesaid was inserted in the certificate fraudulently or without the consent of the real purchaser, or interfere with the right of a third person to proceed against that property, though ostensibly sold to the certified purchaser, on the ground that it is liable to satisfy a claim of such third person against the real owner.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Disposal of proceeds of execution.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>8.</b> (1) Whenever assets are realised by sale or otherwise in execution of a certificate, the proceeds shall be disposed of in the following manner, namely :—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) they shall first be adjusted towards the amount due under the certificate in execution of which the assets were realised and the costs incurred in the course of such execution;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) if there remains a balance after the adjustment referred to in clause (<i>a</i>), the same shall be utilised for satisfaction of any other amount recoverable from the assessee under this Act which may be due on the date on which the assets were realised; and</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>c</i>) the balance, if any, remaining after the adjustments under clauses (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) shall be paid to the defaulter.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) If the defaulter disputes any adjustment under clause (<i>b</i>) of sub-rule (1), the Tax Recovery Officer shall determine the dispute.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>General bar to jurisdiction of civil courts, save where fraud alleged.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>9.</b> Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every question arising between the Tax Recovery Officer and the defaulter or their representatives, relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of a certificate, or relating to the confirmation or setting aside by an order under this Act of a sale held in execution of such certificate, shall be determined, not by suit, but by order of the Tax Recovery Officer before whom such question arises:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that a suit may be brought in a civil court in respect of any such question upon the ground of fraud.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Property exempt from attachment.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>10.</b> (1) All such property as is by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), exempted from attachment and sale in execution of a decree of a civil court shall be exempt from attachment and sale under this Schedule.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) The Tax Recovery Officer's decision as to what property is so entitled to exemption shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Investigation by Tax Recovery Officer.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>11.</b> (1) Where any claim is preferred to, or any objection is made to the attachment or sale of, any property in execution of a certificate, on the ground that such property is not liable to such attachment or sale, the Tax Recovery Officer shall proceed to investigate the claim or objection:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that no such investigation shall be made where the Tax Recovery Officer considers that the claim or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Where the property to which the claim or objection applies has been advertised for sale, the Tax Recovery Officer ordering the sale may postpone it pending the investigation of the claim or objection, upon such terms as to security or otherwise as the Tax Recovery Officer shall deem fit.</p>
<p class="tx">(3) The claimant or objector must adduce evidence to show that—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) (in the case of immovable property) at the date of the service of the notice issued under this Schedule to pay the arrears, or </p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) (in the case of movable property) at the date of the attachment, </p>
<p class="tx">he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the property in question.</p>
<p class="tx">(4) Where, upon the said investigation, the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that, for the reason stated in the claim or objection, such property was not, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter or of some person in trust for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, or that, being in the possession of the defaulter at the said date, it was so in his possession, not on his own account or as his own property, but on account of or in trust for some other person, or partly on his own account and partly on account of some other person, the Tax Recovery Officer shall make an order releasing the property, wholly or to such extent as he thinks fit, from attachment or sale.</p>
<p class="tx">(5) Where the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the property was, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter as his own property and not on account of any other person, or was in the possession of some other person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, the Tax Recovery Officer shall disallow the claim.</p>
<p class="tx">(6) Where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit in a civil court to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute; but, subject to the result of such suit (if any), the order of the Tax Recovery Officer shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Removal of attachment on satisfaction or cancellation of certificate.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>12.</b> Where—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) the amount due, with costs and all charges and expenses resulting from the attachment of any property or incurred in order to hold a sale, are paid to the Tax Recovery Officer, or</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) the certificate is cancelled,</p>
<p class="tx">the attachment shall be deemed to be withdrawn and, in the case of immovable property, the withdrawal shall, if the defaulter so desires, be proclaimed at his expense, and a copy of the proclamation shall be affixed in the manner provided by this Schedule for a proclamation of sale of immovable property.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Officer entitled to attach and sell.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>13.</b> The attachment and sale of movable property and the attachment and sale of immovable property may be made by such persons as the Tax Recovery Officer may from time to time direct.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Defaulting purchaser answerable for loss on resale.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>14. </b>Any deficiency of price which may happen on a resale by reason of the purchaser's default, and all expenses attending such resale, shall be certified to the Tax Recovery Officer by the officer holding the sale, and shall, at the instance of either the Tax Recovery Officer or the defaulter, be recoverable from the defaulting purchaser under the procedure provided by this Schedule:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that no such application shall be entertained unless filed within fifteen days from the date of resale.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Adjournment or stoppage of sale.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>15.</b> (1) The Tax Recovery Officer may, in his discretion, adjourn any sale hereunder to a specified day and hour; and the officer conducting any such sale may, in his discretion, adjourn the sale, recording his reasons for such adjournment:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that, where the sale is made in, or within the precincts of, the office of the Tax Recovery Officer, no such adjournment shall be made without the leave of the Tax Recovery Officer.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Where a sale of immovable property is adjourned under sub-rule (1) for a longer period than one calendar month, a fresh proclamation of sale under this Schedule shall be made unless the defaulter consents to waive it.</p>
<p class="tx">(3) Every sale shall be stopped if, before the lot is knocked down, the arrears and costs (including the costs of the sale) are tendered to the officer conducting the sale, or proof is given to his satisfaction that the amount of such arrears and costs has been paid to the Tax Recovery Officer who ordered the sale.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Private alienation to be void in certain cases.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>16.</b> (1) Where a notice has been served on a defaulter under rule 2, the defaulter or his representative in interest shall not be competent to mortgage, charge, lease or otherwise deal with any property belonging to him except with the permission of the Tax Recovery Officer, nor shall any civil court issue any process against such property in execution of a decree for the payment of money.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Where an attachment has been made under this Schedule, any private transfer or delivery of the property attached or of any interest therein and any payment to the defaulter of any debt, dividend or other moneys contrary to such attachment, shall be void as against all claims enforceable under the attachment.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Prohibition against bidding or purchase by officer.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>17.</b> No officer or other person having any duty to perform in connection with any sale under this Schedule shall, either directly or indirectly, bid for, acquire or attempt to acquire any interest in the property sold.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Prohibition against sale on holidays.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>18.</b> No sale under this Schedule shall take place on a Sunday or other general holiday recognised by the State Government or on any day which has been notified by the State Government to be a local holiday for the area in which the sale is to take place.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Assistance by police.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>19.</b> Any officer authorised to attach or sell any property or to arrest the defaulter or charged with any duty to be performed under this Schedule, may apply to the officer-in-charge of the nearest police station for such assistance as may be necessary in the discharge of his duties, and the authority to whom such application is made shall depute a sufficient number of police officers for furnishing such assistance.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Entrustment of certain functions by Tax Recovery Officer.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>19A.</b> A Tax Recovery Officer may, with the previous approval of the Joint Commissioner, entrust any of his functions as the Tax Recovery Officer to any other officer lower than him in rank (not being lower in rank than an Inspector of Income-tax) and such officer shall, in relation to the functions so entrusted to him, be deemed to be a Tax Recovery Officer.</p>
<p class="tx" style="text-align: center"><i><b>PART II</b></i></p>
<p class="tx" style="text-align: center">ATTACHMENT AND SALE OF MOVABLE PROPERTY</p>
<p class="tx" style="text-align: center"><i>Attachment</i></p>
<p class="tx"><b>Warrant.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>20.</b> Except as otherwise provided in this Schedule, when any movable property is to be attached, the officer shall be furnished by the Tax Recovery Officer (or other officer empowered by him in that behalf) a warrant in writing and signed with his name specifying the name of the defaulter and the amount to be realised.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Service of copy of warrant.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>21.</b> The officer shall cause a copy of the warrant to be served on the defaulter.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Attachment.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>22.</b> If, after service of the copy of the warrant, the amount is not paid forthwith, the officer shall proceed to attach the movable property of the defaulter.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Property in defaulter's possession.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>23.</b> Where the property to be attached is movable property (other than agricultural produce) in the possession of the defaulter, the attachment shall be made by actual seizure, and the officer shall keep the property in his own custody or the custody of one of his subordinates and shall be responsible for due custody thereof:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that when the property seized is subject to speedy and natural decay or when the expense of keeping it in custody is likely to exceed its value, the officer may sell it at once.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Agricultural produce.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>24.</b> Where the property to be attached is agricultural produce the attachment shall be made by affixing a copy of the warrant of attachment—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) where such produce is growing crop,—on the land on which such crop has grown, or</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) where such produce has been cut or gathered,—on the threshing floor or place for treading out grain or the like, or fodder-stack, on or in which it is deposited,</p>
<p class="tx">and another copy on the outer door or on some other conspicuous part of the house in which the defaulter ordinarily resides, or with the leave of the Tax Recovery Officer, on the outer door or on some other conspicuous part of the house in which he carries on business or personally works for gain, or in which he is known to have last resided or carried on business or personally worked for gain. The produce shall, thereupon, be deemed to have passed into the possession of the Tax Recovery Officer.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provisions as to agricultural produce under attachment.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>25. </b>(1) Where agricultural produce is attached, the Tax Recovery Officer shall make such arrangements for the custody, watching, tending, cutting and gathering thereof as he may deem sufficient; and he shall have power to defray the cost of such arrangements.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Subject to such conditions as may be imposed by the Tax Recovery Officer in this behalf, either in the order of attachment or in any subsequent order, the defaulter may tend, cut, gather and store the produce and do any other act necessary for maturing or preserving it; and, if the defaulter fails to do all or any of such acts, any person appointed by the Tax Recovery Officer in this behalf may, subject to the like conditions, do all or any of such acts, and the costs incurred by such person shall be recoverable from the defaulter as if they were included in the certificate.</p>
<p class="tx">(3) Agricultural produce attached as a growing crop shall not be deemed to have ceased to be under attachment or to require reattachment merely because it has been severed from the soil.</p>
<p class="tx">(4) Where an order for the attachment of a growing crop has been made at a considerable time before the crop is likely to be fit to be cut or gathered, the Tax Recovery Officer may suspend the execution of the order for such time as he thinks fit, and may, in his discretion, make a further order prohibiting the removal of the crop pending the execution of the order of attachment.</p>
<p class="tx">(5) A growing crop which from its nature does not admit of being stored shall not be attached under this rule at any time less than twenty days before the time at which it is likely to be fit to be cut or gathered.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Debts and shares, etc.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>26.</b> (1) In the case of—</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>a</i>) a debt not secured by a negotiable instrument,</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>b</i>) a share in a corporation, or</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>c</i>) other movable property not in the possession of the defaulter except property deposited in, or in the custody of, any court,</p>
<p class="tx">the attachment shall be made by a written order prohibiting,—</p>
<p class="indent1A"> (<i>i</i>)  in the case of the debt—the creditor from recovering the debt and the debtor from making payment thereof until the further order of the Tax Recovery Officer;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>ii</i>)  in the case of the share—the person in whose name the share may be standing from transferring the same or receiving any dividend thereon;</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>iii</i>) in the case of the other movable property (except as aforesaid)—the person in possession of the same from giving it over to the defaulter.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) A copy of such order shall be affixed on some conspicuous part of the office of the Tax Recovery Officer, and another copy shall be sent, in the case of the debt, to the debtor, in the case of the share, to the proper officer of the corporation, and in the case of the other movable property (except as aforesaid), to the person in possession of the same.</p>
<p class="tx">(3) A debtor prohibited under clause (<i>i</i>) of sub-rule (1) may pay the amount of his debt to the Tax Recovery Officer, and such payment shall discharge him as effectually as payment to the party entitled to receive the same.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Attachment of decree.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>27.</b> (1) The attachment of a decree of a civil court for the payment of money or for sale in enforcement of a mortgage or charge shall be made by the issue to the civil court of a notice requesting the civil court to stay the execution of the decree unless and until—</p>
<p class="indent1A"> (<i>i</i>)  the Tax Recovery Officer cancels the notice, or</p>
<p class="indent1A">(<i>ii</i>)  the Tax Recovery Officer or the defaulter applies to the court receiving such notice to execute the decree.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) Where a civil court receives an application under clause (<i>ii</i>) of sub-rule (1), it shall, on the application of the Tax Recovery Officer or the defaulter and subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), proceed to execute the attached decree and apply the net proceeds in satisfaction of the certificate.</p>
<p class="tx">(3) The Tax Recovery Officer shall be deemed to be the representative of the holder of the attached decree, and to be entitled to execute such attached decree in any manner lawful for the holder thereof.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Share in movable property.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>28.</b> Where the property to be attached consists of the share or interest of the defaulter in movable property belonging to him and another as co-owners, the attachment shall be made by a notice to the defaulter prohibiting him from transferring the share or interest or charging it in any way.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Salary of Government servants.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>29. </b>Attachment of the salary or allowances of servants of 
the Government or a local authority may be made in the manner provided by rule 48 of Order 21 of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), and the provisions of the said rule shall, for the purposes of this rule, apply subject to such modifications as may be necessary.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Attachment of negotiable instrument.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>30. </b>Where the property is a negotiable instrument not deposited in a court nor in the custody of a public officer, the attachment shall be made by actual seizure, and the instrument shall be brought before the Tax Recovery Officer and held subject to his orders.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Attachment of property in custody of court or public officer.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>31.</b> Where the property to be attached is in the custody of any court or public officer, the attachment shall be made by a notice to such court or officer, requesting that such property, and any interest or dividend becoming payable thereon, may be held subject to the further orders of the Tax Recovery Officer by whom the notice is issued:</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that, where such property is in the custody of a court, any question of title or priority arising between the Tax Recovery Officer and any other person, not being the defaulter, claiming to be interested in such property by virtue of any assignment, attachment or otherwise, shall be determined by such court.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Attachment of partnership property.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>32.</b> (1) Where the property to be attached consists of an interest of the defaulter, being a partner, in the partnership property, the Tax Recovery Officer may make an order charging the share of such partner in the partnership property and profits with payment of the amount due under the certificate, and may, by the same or subsequent order, appoint a receiver of the share of such partner in the profits, whether already declared or accruing and of any other money which may become due to him in respect of the partnership, and direct accounts and inquiries and make an order for the sale of such interest or such other order as the circumstances of the case may require.</p>
<p class="tx">(2) The other persons shall be at liberty at any time to redeem the interest charged or, in the case of a sale being directed, to purchase the same.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Inventory.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>33. </b>In the case of attachment of movable property by actual seizure, the officer shall, after attachment of the property, prepare an inventory of all the property attached, specifying in it the place where it is lodged or kept, and shall forward the same to the Tax Recovery Officer and a copy of the inventory shall be delivered by the officer to the defaulter.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Attachment not to be excessive.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>34.</b> The attachment by seizure shall not be excessive, that is to say, the property attached shall be as nearly as possible proportionate to the amount specified in the warrant.</p>
<p class="tx"><b>Seizure between sunrise and sunset.</b></p>
