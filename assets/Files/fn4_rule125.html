Circular No. 5/2008, dated 14-7-2008 provides that with a view to facilitating electronic payment of taxes by different categories of taxpayers, it is clarified that an assessee can make electronic payment of taxes also from the account of any other person. However, the challan for making such payment must clearly indicate the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the assessee on whose behalf the payment is made. It is not necessary for the assessee to make payment of taxes from his own account in an authorized bank. Further, it is also clarified that payment of any amount by a deductor by way of tax deducted at source (TDS) or tax collected at source (TCS) shall fall within the meaning of 'tax' for the purpose of rule 125.</p>
