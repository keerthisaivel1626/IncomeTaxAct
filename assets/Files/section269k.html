invested in such Government or other securities as it may think proper, and may 
direct the interest or other proceeds of any such investment to be accumulated 
and paid in such manner as will, in its opinion, give the parties interested 
therein the same benefit therefrom as they might have had from the immovable 
property in respect whereof such amount has been deposited or as near thereto as 
may be.</p></div></div><a href="section269j.html">Previous </a>| <a href="section269l.html">Next</a></body></html>
