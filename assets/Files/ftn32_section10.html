<p class="indent1A"><i>32.</i>  Rule 2B prescribes the conditions as well as quantum of exemption, which are as follows :</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0"><i>Conditions to be satisfied</i> - Conditions to be satisfied are as under :</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">♦ The exemption is admissible on the value of any travel concession or assistance received by or due to an assessee from his employer or former employer, as the case may be, for himself and his family, in connection with his proceeding (<i>i</i>) on leave to any place in India, or (<i>ii</i>) to any place in India after the retirement from service, or (<i>iii</i>) to any place in India after the termination of his service.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">♦ The exemption is admissible in respect of actual expenditure incurred for journeys performed, not only by the assessee but also by his family.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">For this purpose, 'family' means (<i>i</i>) the spouse and children of the assessee, and (<i>ii</i>) the parents, brothers and sisters of the assessee provided that they are wholly or mainly dependent on the assessee. With effect from 1-10-1997, the Central Civil Service Leave Travel Concession Rules have been amended in this respect.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">♦ The exemption can be availed only in respect of two <i>journeys</i> performed in a <i>block of four calendar years.</i> For this purpose, the first four-year block commenced with the calendar year 1986. Thus, the four-year blocks will be 2002-05, 2006-09, 2010-13, 2014-17, 2018-21 and so on.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">♦ If an assessee has not availed travel concession or assistance during any of the specified four-year block periods on one of the two permitted occasions, or on both occasions, exemption can be claimed provided he avails the concession or assistance in the calendar year immediately following that block. This is popularly known as the 'carry-over' concession. In such cases, the exemption so availed will not be counted for purposes of regulating the future exemptions allowable for the succeeding block of four years.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0"><i>Quantum of exemption.—</i>The basic rule is that the quantum of exemption will be limited to the actual expenses incurred on the journey. This pre-supposes that, without performing any journey and incurring expenses thereon, no exemption can be claimed.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">In addition to the above general limitation, the quantum of exemption will also be subject to the following maximum limits, depending upon the mode of transport used or available:</p>

<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0"><i>Restricted concession for children.—</i>Under sub-rule (4) of rule 2B, inserted with effect from 1-10-1997, exemption on travel concession will not be admissible to more than two surviving children of an individual born after 1-10-1998. This restriction will not however apply in respect of children born before 1-10-1998, and also in cases where an individual, after getting one child, begets multiple children (twins/triplets/quadruplets, etc.) on the second occasion. The implications of this restriction will be as follows :</p>
<p class="indent2A">  ♦  In respect of journeys performed on or before 1-10-1998 exemption will be admissible in respect of all the surviving children of the individual.</p>
<p class="indent2A">  ♦  In respect of journeys performed after 1-10-1998</p>
<p class="indent3">  -  the exemption will be admissible to all surviving children born before 1-10-1998;</p>
<p class="indent3">  -   in addition, the exemption will be admissible to only two surviving children born on or after 1-10-1998. In reckoning this limit of two children, children born out of multiple birth after the first child will be treated as 'one child' only.</p>
<p class="indent1A" style="text-indent: 0">It may be noted that section 2(<i>15B</i>) of the Act defines a 'child' as includes 'a step-child and an adopted child of the individual'. Hence the aforesaid restrictions will operate in respect of step-children and adopted children also provided they are born on or after 1-10-1998.</p>
