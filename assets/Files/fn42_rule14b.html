Logically, the remuneration payable to the special auditor under section 142(2D) or at least the parameters on which such remuneration is to be determined need to be fixed before the audit is assigned to him. The auditor, to whom the work is assigned, is not under any obligation to accept the assignment and is very much at liberty, while making offer for appointing him as special auditor or while accepting the assignment, to insist upon payment of such fee as he may deem adequate for the work assigned to him. Therefore, necessarily he needs to know, what will be paid to him for the work proposed to be assigned to him. It would be difficult to accept that the special audit can be assigned to a person without fixing either the remuneration or the norms on which the remuneration is to be calculated after the work is completed and conveying the same to him. Taking such a view would amount to giving an arbitrary power to the Chief Commissioner or the Commissioner, as the case may be, to fix any fee which he may decide to fix irrespective of the quantum of the work and the scale on which the remuneration is to be determined taking the quantum of work into consideration. This is not the scheme of section 142(2D). The scheme of the Act does not envisage any consent being obtained from the assessee in respect of the remuneration payable to the special auditor nor does it envisage any consultation with him before determining the said remuneration. The decision of the Chief Commissioner/Commissioner with respect to the remuneration payable to the special auditor is final and binding upon the assessee. The Commissioner while determining the remuneration under section 142(2D) cannot abdicate his duty to determine the remuneration payable to the special auditors, simply by accepting an amount mutually agreed between the auditor and the assessee. - <i>Dhanesh Gupta &amp; Co. </i>v. <i>CIT </i>[2010] 327 ITR 246 (Delhi).</p>
