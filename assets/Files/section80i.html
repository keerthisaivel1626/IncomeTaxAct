business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft and, in either case, the consideration, if any, for such transfer as recorded in the accounts of the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft does not correspond to the market value of such goods as on the date of the transfer, then, for the purposes of the deduction under this section, the profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the business of the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft shall be computed as if the transfer, in either case, had been made at the market value of such goods as on that date :</p><p class="tx"><b>Provided</b> that where, in the opinion of the Assessing Officer, the computation of the profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the business of the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft in the manner hereinbefore specified presents exceptional difficulties, the Assessing Officer may compute such profits and gains on such reasonable basis as he may deem fit.</p><p class="tx"><i>Explanation</i>.—In this sub-section, "market value", in relation to any goods, means the price that such goods would ordinarily fetch on sale in the open market.</p><p class="tx">(9) Where it appears to the Assessing Officer that, owing to the close connection between the assessee carrying on the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft to which this section applies and any other person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so arranged that the business transacted between them produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the operation of the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft, the Assessing Officer shall, in computing the profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the hotel or the ship or the business of repairs to ocean-going vessels or other powered craft for the purposes of the deduction under this section, take the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom.</p><p class="tx">(10) The Central Government may, after making such inquiry as it may think fit, direct, by notification in the Official Gazette, that the exemption conferred by this section shall not apply to any class of industrial undertakings with effect from such date as it may specify in the notification.</p></div></div><a href="section80hhf.html">Previous </a>| <a
